    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate Business & Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive business impact.
      I specialize in building interactive dashboards, automating workflows, and supporting strategic decision-making using tools like SQL, Power BI, Python, and Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work has spanned across industries such as banking, IT services, and trade operations, where I’ve helped teams improve operational efficiency, ensure data quality, and reduce manual processes through automation and reporting solutions.
      I'm skilled at identifying patterns in large datasets and communicating findings through visuals that are easy to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take pride in my ability to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation — whether it's reconciling data from multiple sources, supporting audit readiness, or delivering KPIs that matter.
      I'm continuously learning and enjoy collaborating with teams to build data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.
